Hello SuiteScript Developers!

This project aims to learn concepts discussed in the ff. articles by actually doing them:

[Unlock SuiteScript Efficiency: Save Governance Points with Parent-Child Records](https://www.atsourcepro.com/post/unlock-suitescript-efficiency-save-governance-points-with-parent-child-records)
- [sync-messages](https://github.com/jonarae/suitescript-demos/tree/main/sync-messages)


You can deploy these codes to your account via SuiteCloud as Account Customization Projects.
